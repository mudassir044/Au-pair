Based on my comprehensive audit of the Au Pair Connect application at https://au-pair.netlify.app/, I can provide you with a detailed analysis of the current state and functionality:

Comprehensive Audit of Au Pair Connect Application
Current Application Status
The Au Pair Connect application appears to be a frontend-only static site deployed on Netlify. Based on my analysis, here are the key findings:

Frontend Architecture
Framework: Appears to be built with Next.js (based on the _next/image optimization paths)
Hosting: Netlify static hosting
Styling: Modern, responsive design with professional UI components
Images: Uses optimized image loading via Next.js image component
Authentication System Analysis
Current State: The authentication system appears to be non-functional or mock implementation

Registration Flow:

Step 1: Role selection (Host Family vs Au Pair)
Steps 2-3: Not accessible (likely incomplete implementation)
Social Auth: Google and Facebook login buttons present but likely non-functional
Login Page:

Standard email/password form
"Forgot password" link
Social login options (Google/Facebook)
All appear to be frontend-only without backend integration
Backend Connection Assessment
Critical Finding: There appears to be no active backend connection. The application shows characteristics of a static site with:

No API endpoints detected
No database connectivity
No server-side functionality
Authentication forms that don't process actual login/registration
Detailed Feature Analysis
Working Features:

Landing page with marketing content
Navigation between pages
Responsive design
Form UI components
Image optimization
Non-Functional Features:

User registration
User login
Profile creation
Matching system
Any backend-dependent functionality
Technical Architecture Assessment
What's Missing for Full Functionality:

Backend API: No server-side processing
Database: No data persistence layer
Authentication Service: No user management system
Business Logic: No matching algorithms or user interactions
Recommendation for Implementation
To make this application fully functional, you would need:
