‚ùå I tried deploying the frontend to Netlify, but it failed. Can you please:

Check what might‚Äôve gone wrong (build config, paths, missing files)

Confirm the correct build command and publish directory for Netlify deployment

‚úÖ I now want to deploy the backend to Render. So before I proceed:

Please check that the backend is 100% functional, with no TypeScript or Prisma errors

Make sure yarn and yarn start work, and that the correct PORT variable is being used for Render

üß† MOST IMPORTANT: I want you to double-check and confirm that EVERY SINGLE FEATURE for the full Au Pair ‚Üî Host Family platform has been implemented and tested.

‚úÖ Here‚Äôs the full list that should be working:

Authentication & User Roles

JWT-based auth (register, login, protected routes)

Role-based access control (Au Pair, Host Family, Admin)

Onboarding & Profile System

Full onboarding flow after registration

Editable profiles with dynamic fields (languages, preferences, etc.)

Matchmaking System

Scoring logic (languages, country, age, availability, budget)

Match request feature (send, accept, decline)

Messaging System

Real-time chat via Socket.io

Calendar & Booking

Set availability slots

Send/receive booking requests

Accept/reject booking requests

Calendar view with scheduled meetings

Document Upload & Verification

Upload PDFs/images

Admin verification system

Categorized document types

View/delete functionality

Admin Dashboard

Approve/deactivate users

Verify uploaded documents

View platform statistics

Full admin control panel

Frontend Polish

Tailwind-based responsive UI

Navigation for all pages

Proper error handling (404s, loading states)

Database

Complete schema with relationships for profiles, matches, bookings, messages, documents

‚úÖ Confirm this entire checklist is complete and working, and that I can now:

Deploy the frontend to Netlify

Deploy the backend to Render

Use correct environment variables on both

üì¶ Once you've verified and tested everything end-to-end, please tell me exactly:

What env variables I need to set on Netlify & Render

What ports or bindings I need to be aware of

Any last changes I need to make before deploying

I want to go live with a stable build ‚Äî confirm it‚Äôs ready for production.
