The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed at line 72 due to a compilation error in file "src/app/onboarding/page.tsx" at line 75. The error states that the "use client" directive must be placed before other expressions.

**Solution:**
To resolve this error, move the "use client" directive to the top of the file, before any other expressions like so:

```javascript
'use client';
import { useEffect } from 'react'
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'

// Rest of the code follows...
```

After making this adjustment, commit the changes and trigger a new build to verify the issue is resolved.
