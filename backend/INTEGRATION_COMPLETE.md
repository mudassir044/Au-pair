## 📋 Setup Checklist

To make this **100% functional**, you need to:

### ✅ Completed:

- [x] Backend code implementation
- [x] Database schema design
- [x] API endpoints
- [x] Real-time messaging
- [x] Authentication system
- [x] Error handling
- [x] Documentation

### 🔧 Required Setup:

- [ ] **Create Supabase account and project**
- [ ] **Run the SQL schema** (provided in SETUP_GUIDE.md)
- [ ] **Update .env file** with real Supabase credentials
- [ ] **Configure email service** (optional for development)
- [ ] **Test with frontend** application

## 🎯 What Happens Next

Once you complete the setup:

1. **Au pairs can register** → Profile gets stored in Supabase
2. **Families can register** → Profile gets stored in Supabase
3. **Users can search** → Real database queries return matches
4. **Match requests work** → Status tracked in database
5. **Messages are real** → Stored in database + real-time delivery
6. **Dashboard shows data** → Live statistics from database

## 🧪 Test It Out

Here are some example API calls to test:

```bash
# 1. Check system health
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# 2. Register an au pair
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "sarah@example.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "role": "AU_PAIR"
  }'

# 3. Register a host family
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "family@example.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "role": "HOST_FAMILY"
  }'

# 4. Login and get token
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "sarah@example.com",
    "password": "password123"
  }'

# 5. Use token to access protected routes
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/profiles/me
```
