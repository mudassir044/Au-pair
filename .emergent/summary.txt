The previous AI engineer initiated a full-stack Au-pair application. The project setup involved configuring a Node.js/Express backend with Prisma and a Next.js frontend. Key challenges included: initial Next.js setup difficulties, Prisma schema array type incompatibility with SQLite, persistent TypeScript compilation errors, and server startup issues due to incorrect supervisor configuration (initially trying to run a Python server) and port mismatches. The engineer successfully corrected the supervisor configuration, fixed an email utility function, generated the Prisma client, and, crucially, downgraded Express to resolve major server startup issues. Basic backend authentication (signup, login, protected user endpoint) was verified. The focus then shifted to the frontend, where an  file was created, and supervisor configuration was adjusted for yarn run v1.22.22

However, the frontend is currently failing to launch due to unresolved Next.js installation issues, indicated by next: not found errors. The backend still requires comprehensive TypeScript fixes and full feature implementation.

The objective is to develop a comprehensive MVP for an Au Pair â†” Host Family application. Core features include distinct user types (Au Pair, Host Family), JWT-based authentication with role-based access, detailed profile management (Au Pair: bio, skills, availability; Host: family profile, kids), a matchmaking system based on various criteria, a booking calendar for availability and requests, one-on-one real-time messaging via Socket.io, and secure document/video upload to Supabase Storage. An optional admin tool for user management is also part of the scope. The tech stack specifies Next.js/TypeScript for the frontend and Node.js/Express/TypeScript with PostgreSQL/Prisma for the backend. Supabase Storage and Nodemailer with Ethereal are chosen for third-party integrations. The deployment strategy involves Netlify for the frontend and Render for the backend, with all major flows expected to be fully functional before submission. The database schema includes User, AuPairProfile, HostFamilyProfile, Match, Messages, Document, and Booking models.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Development**: Next.js frontend, Node.js/Express backend.
-   **Authentication**: JWT for secure sessions and role-based access.
-   **Database ORM**: Prisma for PostgreSQL (using SQLite for dev).
-   **Real-time Communication**: Socket.io for chat.
-   **File Storage**: Supabase Storage for uploads.
-   **Email Services**: Nodemailer for verification.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack setup with  (Next.js) and  (Express) directories.

Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully got the backend server running and verified basic authentication functionalities. This involved:
1.  **Supervisor Configuration Fix**: Identifying that supervisor was attempting to run a Python/FastAPI server for the backend, which was corrected to run the Node.js/Express application. Similarly, the frontend command was updated from  to yarn run v1.22.22

2.  **Environment Variable Alignment**: Correcting the  in  to  to match the supervisor's expected port.
3.  **Dependency Management**: Running yarn install v1.22.22

Done in 0.16s. in the backend, generating the Prisma client (), and then crucially, downgrading  and  to version 4.x to resolve significant TypeScript compilation errors that were preventing the server from starting.
4.  **Backend Verification**: After these fixes, the backend server successfully started, and its health check () returned OK. Furthermore, basic authentication endpoints (, ) and a protected user endpoint () were successfully tested, confirming initial backend functionality.
5.  **Frontend Setup Attempt**: The focus then shifted to the frontend. A  file was created with  (though the value wasn't explicitly set in the trajectory). The supervisor configuration for the frontend was updated to use yarn run v1.22.22
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command.. However, subsequent attempts to start the frontend (yarn run v1.22.22
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command. manually and via supervisor restart) resulted in  errors.

The current state is that the backend has a working basic authentication system, but still has outstanding TypeScript errors and incomplete feature implementations. The frontend is currently unable to start due to  not being found, indicating a problem with Next.js installation or its PATH configuration within the environment. The last observed action was the AI engineer deciding to check  and reinstall frontend dependencies.

<optional_next_step>
Reinstall frontend dependencies and ensure Next.js is properly installed and executable to get the frontend server running.
