The AI engineer was tasked with building a full-stack Au-pair application from scratch based on a detailed product specification. The work began with an initial environment check, revealing an empty  and a basic . After clarifying third-party integration preferences (Supabase for storage, Nodemailer with Ethereal for email), the engineer initiated the project setup.

The process encountered initial friction with Next.js setup due to existing files, requiring manual cleanup. Following this, the backend was set up using Express, TypeScript, and Prisma, involving extensive file creation for middleware, utilities, sockets, and routes. Database schema definition with Prisma proved challenging, specifically with array types for SQLite, necessitating schema modifications and seed file adjustments. TypeScript compilation errors and server startup issues (nodemon, CORS, missing types) plagued the backend development, leading the engineer to defer full backend resolution. The final decision was to pivot to frontend setup, attempting to install dependencies for the Next.js application, which also seemed to face issues, leading to manual  edits. The current state is mid-frontend dependency setup, with an incomplete and error-prone backend.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build a full MVP for an Au Pair â†” Host Family application.
**Core Features:**
*   **User Types**: Au Pair, Host Family.
*   **Authentication**: JWT (access/refresh tokens), email/password signup/login, role-based access.
*   **Profile Management**: Au Pair (bio, skills, video URL, availability, preferred countries); Host (family profile, number of kids, preferences).
*   **Matchmaking System**: Backend matches based on language, availability, country, age, with a soft match percentage.
*   **Booking Calendar**: Au Pairs set availability; Hosts request periods; accept/decline logic.
*   **Messaging**: One-on-one chat (Socket.io) between matched users, history stored in DB, available after mutual interest.
*   **Document Upload**: ID, Passport, Visa; stored in AWS S3 or Supabase Storage, marked pending/verified.
*   **Video Intro Support**: Users paste YouTube URL or upload (external storage), shown on profile.
*   **Admin Tools (optional MVP)**: Basic dashboard, user list, suspend/verify accounts.

**Tech Stack:**
*   **Frontend**: Next.js (TypeScript), TailwindCSS, React Hook Form, React Calendar, Socket.io Client, Axios.
*   **Backend**: Node.js + Express (TypeScript), PostgreSQL + Prisma, Socket.io, Multer, AWS S3/Supabase, JWT Auth, Nodemailer/SendGrid.

**Third-Party Services:**
*   **File Storage**: Supabase Storage (initially for dev).
*   **Email Verification**: Nodemailer with Ethereal Email (initially for dev).

**Deployment:**
*   **Netlify (Frontend)**:  folder,  to backend URL, .
*   **Render (Backend)**:  folder,  endpoint, auto-deploy from GitHub, PostgreSQL on Render.

**Build Strategy**: Build all features at once (full frontend UI, full backend with working endpoints/tests). Submission only when all major flows work,  returns OK, and frontend consumes real backend.

**Database Schema (Prisma)**: Includes , , , , , ,  models with specified fields.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Application**: React/Next.js frontend, Node.js/Express backend.
-   **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user sessions and role-based access.
-   **Database ORM**: Prisma for PostgreSQL, initially using SQLite for development.
-   **Real-time Communication**: Socket.io for one-on-one chat.
-   **File Storage**: Supabase Storage for user document and video uploads.
-   **Email Services**: Nodemailer with Ethereal Email for verification.
-   **Deployment**: Netlify (frontend) and Render (backend).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a  (Next.js) and  (Express) directory.



**Key Files and Changes:**

*   :
    *   **Importance**: Defines backend dependencies (Express, Prisma, Socket.io, JWT, Multer, dotenv, CORS, etc.) and scripts.
    *   **Changes**: Initialized with yarn init v1.22.22

    *   **Changes**: Modified to include  in  array and adjust  to .
*   :
    *   **Importance**: Defines the application's database schema (User, AuPairProfile, HostFamilyProfile, Match, Messages, Document, Booking).
    *   **Changes**: Initial schema created. Crucially, array types (, ) were modified to  (with  or ) to be compatible with SQLite in development, specifically for  in , and  in .

The last observed action was the AI engineer reading the  file. The backend, although scaffolded with many files and an initial database schema, is not fully functional and requires significant debugging and completion, as indicated by the prior TypeScript compilation errors and server startup failures. The AI engineer explicitly stated, The core backend structure is set up, so let me continue with the frontend development while keeping the backend for later completion. This suggests the current priority is frontend setup, despite the backend being in an incomplete state.
